## gatekeeper

**Gatekeeper** (*noun*): a person or thing that controls access to something.

**Gatekeeper** is an authenticated reverse proxy written in Python using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [PonyORM](https://ponyorm.com/).

While I am publishing *most* of gatekeeper's source to GitHub, **this project was primarily designed for my own internal use.**
